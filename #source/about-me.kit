				<p>Hello I’m Danila, a self-taught frontend developer based in Russia.</p>
				<p>I have a passion for web development. It is the good way to challenge myself and use a mix of
					technologies
					and creativity. I like the endless learning process especially when I see the amazing result of my work.
				</p>
				<p>I like to write semantic, cross browser compatible code by hand that is re-useable, maintainable and easy
					to
					understand. My keen interest in programming and design helps me find creative solutions to technical
					challenges.</p>
				<p>The main areas of my expertise are HTML(5), CSS(3) and JavaScript but I have intermediate knowledge of
					MySQL. I regularly use version control systems (GIT) to maintain my code, and I specialize in responsive
					web
					design (RWD).</p>
				<p>I’m in love with what I do, and I always try to better myself with every project I work on. </p>
				<p>I’m open to job and project opportunities. </p>
				<p>Interested in working with me? <a href="./contacts.html">Get in touch</a> and I’d be happy to discuss
					your
					project.</p>
